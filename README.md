# Library Workshop - Getting to Know Version Control with Git and GitHub

This is the repo for a presentation/demo given as part of the UMass Amherst Libraries Workshop Series

This repo contains three things in addition to this README file: 

* PITCHME.md - this is the file that will render into the presentation slides, available here: https://gitpitch.com/tpatwood/library-workshop-20191101
* lessonHandout-git.doc - the handout that accompanies the presentation, handed out during the session
* lessonNotes-git.doc - my notes for the presentation. 

This presentation is based significantly off of the Library Carpentry, available here: https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/ 

Thanks! :-)
